# NMS_QAOA
This repository provides a quantum-classical hybrid solution to the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) problem, a key step in object detection pipelines. The NMS task is first formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, then efficiently solved using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).
